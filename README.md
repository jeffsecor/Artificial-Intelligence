# Artificial-Intelligence
## A non programmng physicist/gardeners approach to AI

The term "Artificial Intelligence", or AI, is not appropriate, in my opinion.  I do not think that what AI is trying to achieve is artificial.  Nor do I think that what AI should be striving for is intellegence.  What separates sentient creatures (humans are not exclusive to this group) is the ability to learn.  Learning is the changing of the rules of operation.  Classical computer programs are based on a set of hard coded rules, so one would not expect to call those programs intelligent.  

Consider the following
```
You ask a computer "Hey computer, what is two plus three?"  

The computer responds "I read some notes I found from an elementary school book, and I think the answer is five.

```
The computer gathered knowledge it did not have, and 'thought' it had come up with a solution it had never done before.  If this were a child, one would be hesitant to say the child is intelligent.  But what about the computer?  Is that intelligence?

Nature has created our brains to be able to process information and make choices and actions, and to change future choices and actions based on new information.  Nature does not always get it right.  In many cases, nature gets it wrong.  Sometimes terrible wrong.  And that is necessary in order to have a complex system such as 'intelligence'.  In order for the system to be able to change its rules, the rules must be able to change.  Sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse.  I think this is the type of operations that we should be coding into computers.  It is not artificial.  It is what nature does.  It is a process, irrespective of physical makeup.  Our neuronal based decision making is no more or less artificial then electrons or photons generating binary (soon to be quantum) signals on a chip.

Machine learning is a good term, but it does inspire images of the terminator and robots coming to kill us.  It also does not capture the independence of the development process.  As time goes on, I'll try to come up with a better term.
